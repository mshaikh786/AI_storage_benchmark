If running as an unprivileged user, you may want to comment out line 30 in dload.py script.
This line attempts to drop Linux file cache to avoid caching effect (i.e. emulating IO_DIRECT)

The script output is redirected to a file called raw.output
To generate a concise report with metrics to be inserted in the prescibed evaluation table in the RFP document
plese run the following post-procesing script:
